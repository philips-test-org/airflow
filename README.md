Airflow is a practice management tool. It is meant to replace whiteboard workflows in departments. This is where a literal white board and index cards are used to track patients through the process of receiving a procedure or exam. As such this is a tactical application for a department and is primarily used for communication and tracking workflow.

The calendar view is built for schedulars and nurses to be able to move exams/cases around and understand their timing.

The overview is built for physicians to get a consolidated view of the current status of cases in a compact space. The goal being to see what's happened/happening while still being able to see when their day will end (last case).

The kiosk view is for the patient waiting room and is intended to communicate a simple set of status for family members without showing PHI.
